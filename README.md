# To-Do List Web App

Hey!   
This is a simple To-Do List web application I built using just **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It was created as part of my web development internship task.

## What It Does

- Lets you **add new tasks**
- You can **mark tasks as completed**
- You can also **delete tasks**
- UI updates instantly — no page reloads

I kept things clean and easy to use. There are two sections: one for pending tasks and another for completed tasks. When you complete a task, it moves down automatically.

## Technologies I Used

- HTML for the structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for all the interactive stuff

## Key Things I Practiced

- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners and event handling
- Adding/removing elements dynamically
- Writing clean, modular code in JS

## Files

- `index.html` – main structure of the app
- `styles.css` – all the styling
- `script.js` – functionality like add/complete/remove task

## How to Run It

You can just open the `index.html` file in any browser (I used Live Server in VS Code for testing).



## Done For

This project was done for Task 2 of the internship (Build a To-Do List Web App with Vanilla JS).
